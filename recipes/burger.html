        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A burger is a food consisting of fillings —usually a patty of ground meat, typically 
            beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, 
            lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, 
            mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; 
            and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a 
            cheeseburger.
